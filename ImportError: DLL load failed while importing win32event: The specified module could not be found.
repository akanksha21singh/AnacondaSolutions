1. In my case there were 2 versions of python. Make sure you have only one and completely clean the other version.
2. Unsinstall previously installed Anaconda if any. Make sure there's no residue of it in yor system, not even the shortcuts. Problems might be caused due to duplicates.
3. pip install pywin32==225 in your Anaconda powershell.
